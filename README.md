# <Camping-Planner>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This is a group project for the UT Coding Bootcamp. The objective of our project was to create a camping planner application that allows the user to check weather conditions and compare that to national park options in their desired location. The project allowed the group to practice javascript skills including fetch requests and dynamically inserting elements, as well as the use of a CSS library for styling, and screen responsiveness concepts.
