# <Camping-Planner>

## Description

This is a group project for the UT Coding Bootcamp. The objective of our project was to create a camping planner application that allows the user to check weather conditions and compare that to national park options in their desired location. The project allowed the group to practice javascript skills including fetch requests and dynamically inserting elements, as well as the use of a CSS library for styling, and screen responsiveness concepts.


## Installation

There is no installation required. The application runs in the browser.

## Usage

Use the links in the navigation bar to navigate to the various sections of the page.
Search for a city in the “choose your location” section to search for your desired campsite location and return results listing available national park campsites in that area. The campground amenities section will let you know the features available at your selected campgrounds.
